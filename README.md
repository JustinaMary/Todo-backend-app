# Todo backend application

**Tools used**


**NodeJS** - We're going to use this to run JavaScript code on the server. I've decided to use the latest version of Node, v6.3.0 at the time of writing, so that we'll have access to most of the new features introduced in ES6.

**Express** - As per their website, Express is a "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js", that we're going to be building our Todo list application on.

**PostgreSQ** - This is a powerful open-source database that we're going to use to store our Todos.

**Sequelize**- In addition, we're going to use Sequelize, which is a database ORM that will interface with the Postgres database for us.
